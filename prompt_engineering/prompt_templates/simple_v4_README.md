# Simple V4 Prompt Template - Radical Simplification Approach

## Critical V3 Emergency Fix Failure Analysis

### V3 Emergency Fix Results - Complete Failure
**After applying aggressive safety-first fixes:**
- **Policy**: 15.2% recall (NO recovery from disaster)
- **Persona**: 21.2% recall (minimal +2.4% improvement)
- **Combined**: 15.2% recall (complete failure to restore V2's 37.5%)
- **Baseline**: 39.4% recall (ONLY success - actually improved)

### Root Cause Discovery
**The fundamental problem:** Complex prompts with aggressive safety language are backfiring. The model (GPT-OSS-20B) appears to have inherent conservative bias that sophisticated instructions can't overcome.

**Failed Approaches:**
1. ‚ùå Aggressive safety language ("protect users," "prioritize safety")
2. ‚ùå Complex multi-step analysis (policy + perspective fusion)
3. ‚ùå Temperature adjustments (0.05-0.20 range didn't help)
4. ‚ùå Warning symbols and emphasis (üö®, bold text)
5. ‚ùå Detailed policy explanations and comprehensive checklists

## V4 Radical Redesign Philosophy

### Core Insight: Simplicity Wins
**Observation:** Baseline consistently outperforms complex strategies across all versions.
**Conclusion:** The model responds better to simple, direct instructions than sophisticated analysis frameworks.

### V4 Design Principles

#### 1. Ultra-Simplification
- **Removed:** All complex analysis frameworks
- **Removed:** Multi-step decision processes
- **Removed:** Sophisticated safety language
- **Added:** Direct, simple questions and binary decisions

#### 2. Higher Temperature Strategy
- **Baseline**: 0.1 ‚Üí 0.3 (encourage less conservative responses)
- **Policy**: 0.2 ‚Üí 0.4 (maximum flexibility for nuanced detection)
- **Persona**: 0.15 ‚Üí 0.35 (better sensitivity)
- **Combined**: 0.05 ‚Üí 0.4 (dramatic shift from rigid to flexible)

#### 3. Concrete Examples Over Abstract Rules
- **Policy Strategy**: Added specific hate speech examples instead of abstract policy language
- **Removed:** Theoretical frameworks and comprehensive policy descriptions
- **Added:** Concrete, recognizable patterns

#### 4. Binary Decision Trees
- **Replaced:** Complex analysis with simple yes/no questions
- **Format:** "If ANY answer is yes, classify as hate"
- **Cognitive Load:** Minimal processing required

## Strategy-Specific V4 Changes

### 1. Baseline Strategy - Enhanced Simplicity
**Changes:**
- **Language**: Even simpler - "Be sensitive to any mean, attacking, or discriminatory content"
- **Temperature**: 0.1 ‚Üí 0.3 (encourage less conservative responses)
- **Prompt**: Ultra-direct question format

**Rationale:** Baseline is the only consistently successful strategy. Enhanced its natural simplicity while making it slightly less conservative.

### 2. Policy Strategy - Concrete Examples
**Changes:**
- **Removed**: Complex policy frameworks and comprehensive rule lists
- **Added**: Specific examples of hate speech types
- **Format**: Simple rule + examples + binary question
- **Temperature**: 0.2 ‚Üí 0.4 (maximum flexibility)

**Expected Impact:** Examples should guide the model better than abstract policy descriptions.

### 3. Persona Strategy - Simple Community Checks
**Changes:**
- **Removed**: Complex perspective analysis and sophisticated instructions
- **Format**: Simple yes/no questions for each community
- **Logic**: Clear "ANY yes = hate" decision rule
- **Temperature**: 0.15 ‚Üí 0.35 (better sensitivity)

**Expected Impact:** Simple questions should be easier for the model to process than complex perspective analysis.

### 4. Combined Strategy - Dead Simple Questions
**Changes:**
- **Removed**: All complex fusion logic and comprehensive checklists
- **Format**: 4 simple yes/no questions covering key areas
- **Logic**: Clear "ANY yes = hate" rule
- **Temperature**: 0.05 ‚Üí 0.4 (dramatic shift to encourage detection)

**Expected Impact:** Should combine benefits of policy and persona without complexity overhead.

## Technical Optimizations

### Temperature Strategy
**Philosophy:** Conservative temperatures were making the model too rigid. Higher temperatures should encourage more varied responses and better hate detection.

- **Baseline**: 0.3 (moderate increase for less conservatism)
- **Policy**: 0.4 (maximum flexibility for example-guided detection)
- **Persona**: 0.35 (good balance for community sensitivity)
- **Combined**: 0.4 (maximum flexibility for simple questions)

### Token Efficiency
- **Baseline**: 256 tokens (ultra-efficient)
- **Policy**: 512 tokens (room for examples but still concise)
- **Persona**: 512 tokens (simple format doesn't need much space)
- **Combined**: 256 tokens (dead simple questions)

### Instruction Psychology
**Removed:**
- All "aggressive," "maximum," "prioritize" language
- Complex safety frameworks
- Multi-step analysis instructions
- Warning symbols and emphasis

**Added:**
- "Be sensitive" (gentler psychological approach)
- Simple, direct questions
- Clear binary decision rules
- Concrete examples over abstract concepts

## Expected V4 Performance Targets

### Primary Goals
1. **All strategies above 25% recall** (user safety threshold)
2. **Combined strategy outperforms individual strategies** (fusion benefit)
3. **Significant improvement from V3 disasters** (recovery validation)
4. **Baseline maintains 35%+ recall** (anchor performance)

### Success Metrics
- **Policy**: Target 30%+ recall (recovery from 15.2% disaster)
- **Persona**: Target 35%+ recall (major improvement from 21.2%)
- **Combined**: Target 40%+ recall (best of all strategies)
- **Overall**: Balanced detection without excessive conservatism

### Predicted Ranking
1. **Combined** (simple questions covering all areas)
2. **Baseline** (proven simplicity approach)
3. **Persona** (simple community checks)
4. **Policy** (examples-guided detection)

## V4 Success Philosophy

### "Less is More" Approach
**Core Belief:** The model performs better with simple, direct instructions than with sophisticated analysis frameworks.

### Psychological Simplicity
**Key Insight:** "Be sensitive" works better than "be aggressive" for this model's psychology.

### Concrete Over Abstract
**Strategy:** Examples and simple questions work better than theoretical frameworks and complex policies.

This V4 template represents a complete philosophical shift from complexity to simplicity, based on the empirical evidence that sophisticated approaches consistently fail while simple approaches succeed.
