## GPT-5 Specific Architecture Analysis

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **API Compatibility Note**

This template uses GPT-5's constrained parameter set with architecture optimization approach. Given GPT-5's parameter limitations (only `max_tokens` and `temperature=1.0` supported), we leverage prompt architecture variations rather than hyperparameter tuning. GPT-5's enhanced reasoning capabilities are exploited through sophisticated prompt engineering and architectural design rather than explicit parameter controls.

### üéØ **Architecture Optimization for GPT-5**

GPT-5's architectural improvements enable sophisticated prompt engineering optimization [1]. Research demonstrates that advanced models benefit more from structural prompt variations than parameter tuning, supporting architecture-focused optimization for critical classification tasks [2].

- **Hybrid**: Adaptive efficiency combining GPT-5's speed and accuracy capabilities

### üéØ **max_tokens Allocation for Architecture Types**

GPT-5's efficiency improvements allow for optimized token allocation per architecture. Research on large language model evaluation shows that performance scales with architecture-appropriate token allocation [2]. Architecture-specific studies demonstrate that token efficiency varies significantly by reasoning complexity [3]:

- **150 (Direct Binary)**: Ultra-efficient for high-speed classification
- **400 (Chain/Confidence)**: Balanced allocation for structured reasoning
- **500 (Adversarial/Hybrid)**: Advanced analysis with robust consideration
- **600 (Multi-Perspective)**: Comprehensive viewpoint analysis
