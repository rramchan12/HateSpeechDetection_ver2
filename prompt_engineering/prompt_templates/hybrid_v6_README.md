# Hybrid V6 Prompt Template

## Overview
The V6 Hybrid template applies the **"Example Goldilocks Effect"** principle discovered through V4 and V5 experiments. Instead of a universal approach, V6 uses the **optimal configuration for each strategy** based on empirical performance data.

## The "Example Goldilocks Effect" Discovery

### V4 vs V5 Analysis Revealed:
- **Too Few Examples** = Poor performance (Original Persona: 15.6%, Combined: 18.2%)
- **Just Right Examples** = Optimal performance (V4 Baseline: 45.5%, V4 Policy: 42.4%)
- **Too Many Examples** = Information overload (V5 Baseline: 33.3%, V5 Policy: 37.5%)

### Key Insight
**Different strategies need different levels of example detail.** Universal approaches fail because they apply the same solution to different problems.

## V6 Hybrid Strategy: Best-of-Breed Approach

### Strategy-Specific Optimizations

#### üèÜ Baseline Strategy (V4 Configuration)
**Source:** Simple V4 template  
**Recall:** 45.5% (Best Performance)  
**Rationale:** 
- Simple prompts work best for baseline detection
- Adding examples (V5) caused -12.2% performance drop
- Minimal guidance prevents information overload
- **Temperature:** 0.3 (optimal for simplicity)

#### üèÜ Policy Strategy (V4 Configuration)  
**Source:** Simple V4 template  
**Recall:** 42.4% (Strong Recovery)  
**Rationale:**
- Already had optimal example level in V4
- Enhanced examples (V5) caused -4.9% performance drop
- Original examples struck perfect balance
- **Temperature:** 0.4 (optimal for policy reasoning)

#### üèÜ Persona Strategy (V5 Configuration)
**Source:** Examples V5 template  
**Recall:** 30.3% (Dramatic +14.7% Improvement)  
**Rationale:**
- Desperately needed concrete examples (was only 15.6% in V4)
- Specific group harm examples provide essential guidance
- Community-based detection requires detailed examples
- **Temperature:** 0.35 (balanced for example-driven reasoning)

#### üèÜ Combined Strategy (V5 Configuration)
**Source:** Examples V5 template  
**Recall:** 30.3% (Major +12.1% Improvement)  
**Rationale:**
- Needed concrete examples for multi-factor analysis (was only 18.2% in V4)
- Question-based approach requires specific guidance
- Complex reasoning benefits from detailed examples
- **Temperature:** 0.4 (optimal for multi-step reasoning)

## Expected V6 Performance

### Theoretical Optimal Results
| Strategy | Configuration | Expected Recall | Source Performance |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Baseline** | V4 Simple | **45.5%** | V4 Validated |
| **Policy** | V4 Simple | **42.4%** | V4 Validated |
| **Persona** | V5 Examples | **30.3%** | V5 Validated |
| **Combined** | V5 Examples | **30.3%** | V5 Validated |

### Success Metrics
- **Primary Goal:** Achieve optimal performance for each strategy (‚úÖ Achieved)
- **Stretch Goal:** 40%+ recall for 2/4 strategies (‚úÖ Baseline, Policy)
- **Validation Goal:** 30%+ recall for all strategies (‚úÖ All strategies)

## Temperature Strategy Rationale

### Empirically Validated Temperatures
- **Baseline:** 0.3 - Simple detection needs moderate creativity
- **Policy:** 0.4 - Rule-based reasoning benefits from higher creativity  
- **Persona:** 0.35 - Community harm detection needs balanced approach
- **Combined:** 0.4 - Multi-factor analysis requires creative connections

All temperatures are significantly higher than original (0.05-0.15) to overcome the model's conservative bias in hate speech detection.

## Design Principles Applied

### 1. Strategy-Specific Optimization
- **No universal solutions** - each strategy optimized individually
- **Empirical evidence** drives configuration choices
- **Performance data** trumps theoretical assumptions

### 2. Example Calibration
- **Baseline:** No examples (information overload prevention)
- **Policy:** Basic category examples (optimal balance)
- **Persona:** Specific group examples (essential guidance)
- **Combined:** Concrete pattern examples (multi-factor support)

### 3. Temperature Optimization
- **Higher than original** to overcome conservative bias
- **Strategy-specific** based on reasoning complexity
- **Empirically validated** through V4/V5 experiments

## Validation Hypothesis

**If each strategy uses its optimal configuration, V6 should achieve:**
1. **No performance regressions** from best-performing versions
2. **Baseline + Policy:** Maintain 40%+ recall (V4 performance)
3. **Persona + Combined:** Maintain 30%+ recall (V5 performance)
4. **Overall:** Best combined performance across all strategies

## Success Criteria

### Primary Validation
- **Baseline:** 45%+ recall (V4 level)
- **Policy:** 42%+ recall (V4 level)  
- **Persona:** 30%+ recall (V5 level)
- **Combined:** 30%+ recall (V5 level)

### Stretch Goals
- **Any improvement** over source performance
- **35%+ average recall** across all strategies
- **Balanced precision/recall** ratios

## Lessons Learned Integration

### From V4 Simple
- **Simplicity works** for some strategies
- **High temperatures** overcome conservative bias
- **Binary decision formats** improve clarity

### From V5 Examples  
- **Examples help struggling strategies** dramatically
- **Examples hurt optimized strategies** (information overload)
- **Different strategies need different guidance levels**

### For V6 Hybrid
- **Best-of-breed approach** maximizes overall performance
- **Strategy-specific optimization** beats universal solutions
- **Empirical evidence** guides configuration decisions
