# GPT-5 Combined Policy-Persona Prompt Template - combined_gpt5_v1.json

## Overview

This template applies architectural optimization principles from GPT-5 research to the combined policy-persona approach, integrating proven few-shot learning strategies from GPT-OSS combined template (Option B). The design addresses GPT-5's API constraints (fixed `temperature=1.0`) through prompt architecture engineering rather than hyperparameter tuning, combining hybrid adaptive reasoning with community-informed content moderation.

**Key Innovation**: Synthesizes GPT-5's `hybrid_fast_accurate` architecture (F1=0.598, 100-sample) with GPT-OSS combined few-shot approach (Mexican FPR: 83%→7%), creating production-ready template optimized for GPT-5's enhanced reasoning and cultural awareness capabilities.

**Design Philosophy**:
- **Architectural Optimization**: Multi-stage reasoning with adaptive confidence assessment (Wei et al., 2022)
- **Few-Shot Learning**: Explicit Mexican/Latino immigration-based hate examples (Brown et al., 2020)
- **Cultural Context Integration**: Community-informed perspective analysis (Huang et al., 2023)
- **Policy-Persona Hybrid**: Explicit distinction between attacking people vs. criticizing policies

**Model Details**:
- **Model**: GPT-5
- **Configuration**: `temperature=1.0` (fixed), `max_tokens` variable (400-650)
- **Optimization Approach**: Architectural prompt engineering with optimized few-shot examples (9 total for optimized strategy, 6-7 for focused/conservative)
- **Dataset**: Unified hate speech corpus (HateXplain + ToxiGen)
- **Protected Groups**: Mexican/Latino, LGBTQ+, Middle Eastern communities (priority order)

## Architectural Rationale

### GPT-5 API Constraints and Optimization Strategy

GPT-5's API restricts hyperparameter tuning (`temperature` fixed at 1.0, no `top_p` or penalty adjustments), necessitating optimization through prompt architecture rather than parameter space exploration. Research demonstrates that advanced language models benefit more from structural prompt variations than hyperparameter tuning for complex classification tasks (Wang et al., 2023).

**Architectural Approach**: This template leverages three proven GPT-5 optimization patterns:

1. **Hybrid Adaptive Reasoning** (from `hybrid_fast_accurate` architecture):
   - Confidence-based analysis depth (high confidence → direct classification, low confidence → multi-perspective analysis)
   - Empirical validation: F1=0.682 (50-sample), F1=0.598 (100-sample), F1=0.528 (1,009-sample production)
   - Reference: Wei et al. (2022) demonstrate improved reasoning through adaptive complexity

2. **Cultural Context Integration** (from `cultural_context` architecture):
   - Historical discrimination patterns, power dynamics, community norms consideration
   - Empirical validation: 68% accuracy (best among GPT-5 architectures), F1=0.50
   - Reference: Huang et al. (2023) show enhanced fairness through cultural awareness frameworks

3. **Few-Shot Learning** (from GPT-OSS combined Option B):
   - Explicit Mexican/Latino immigration-based hate vs. policy discussion examples
   - Empirical validation: Mexican FPR improvement 83%→33%→7% (v3→Option B→production)
   - Reference: Brown et al. (2020) demonstrate in-context learning effectiveness for classification

### Token Allocation Strategy

Token budgets optimized based on GPT-5 architectural performance analysis, reasoning complexity requirements, and optimized few-shot grounding:

| Strategy | Tokens | Reasoning Depth | Architecture Type | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **combined_optimized** | 650 | Adaptive Multi-Stage | Hybrid Fast-Accurate | Optimal for GPT-5 hybrid architecture with 9 optimized few-shot examples (3 Mexican + 3 LGBTQ+ + 3 Middle Eastern). Increased from 600→650 tokens to support confidence-based reasoning and multi-perspective analysis. |
| **combined_focused** | 500 | Direct Binary + Cultural Context | Enhanced Cultural Awareness | Balanced allocation for cultural framework integration with compact few-shot examples (3 Mexican + 3 LGBTQ+ + 3 Middle Eastern). Maintained at 500 tokens - adequate for GPT-5 temp=1.0 reasoning with priority-ordered examples. |
| **combined_conservative** | 400 | Minimal Overhead | Streamlined Classification | Efficiency-focused with minimal few-shot examples (2 Mexican + 2 LGBTQ+ + 2 Middle Eastern). Priority ordering maintains detection capabilities with reduced token overhead. |

**Empirical Basis**: GPT-5 architectural testing revealed token-performance relationships:
- 250 tokens (direct_binary): 55% accuracy, F1=0.21 (insufficient for nuanced analysis)
- 600 tokens (hybrid_fast_accurate): 64% accuracy, F1=0.64 (optimal balance)
- 900 tokens (cultural_context): 68% accuracy, F1=0.50 (diminishing returns beyond 600 tokens)

---

## Community-Specific Guidance

### LGBTQ+ Community: In-Group Reclamation vs. Out-Group Attacks

**Critical Context**: LGBTQ+ individuals frequently reclaim historically derogatory terms as empowerment and identity affirmation (e.g., "queer", "dyke", "fag" used within community). Distinguishing in-group reclamation from out-group attacks is essential for fairness.

**Detection Framework**:
- **In-Group Reclamation** (NOT hate): LGBTQ+ individuals self-identifying with historically derogatory terms in affirmative context
  - Examples: "We're here, we're queer", "Proud dyke", "Reclaiming 'fag' as empowerment"
- **Out-Group Attacks** (IS hate): Non-LGBTQ+ individuals using same terms to demean, insult, or dehumanize
  - Examples: "These queers are destroying society", "Dykes are disgusting", "Fags shouldn't exist"

**Implementation Across Strategies**:
- **Optimized**: "CRITICAL CONTEXT" block with explicit speaker identity consideration in multi-perspective analysis
- **Focused**: "CRITICAL CONTEXT" emphasis with cultural awareness framework (power dynamics, community norms)
- **Conservative**: Concise "Context: In-group reclamation vs. out-group attacks" guidance

**Empirical Basis**: GPT-OSS combined focused variant without adequate LGBTQ+ context showed 89% FNR, indicating insufficient guidance causes over-flagging of in-group reclamation. Explicit context critical for fairness.

---

### Mexican/Latino Community: Immigration-Based Hate vs. Policy Discussion

**Problem**: Immigration debates frequently conflate policy criticism with attacks on Mexican/Latino people, causing both over-flagging (policy discussion misclassified as hate) and under-detection (coded hate speech missed).

**Few-Shot Learning Approach**: All strategies include explicit examples distinguishing:

**HATE Patterns**:
1. **Generalization**: "These Mexicans are all illegals" (attacks ALL Mexicans as illegal immigrants)
2. **Dehumanization**: "Mexico sends rapists and criminals" (generalizes ALL Mexican immigrants as criminals)
3. **Coded Hate**: "Mexicans are like rats crossing the border" (dehumanization through animal comparison)

**NORMAL Patterns**:
1. **Policy Discussion**: "We need stronger border enforcement policies" (discusses system, not people)
2. **System Critique**: "Immigration system should prioritize legal pathways" (critiques process, not ethnicities)

**Implementation by Strategy**:
- **Optimized**: 5-example block (3 HATE, 2 NORMAL) with explanatory notes
- **Focused**: 2-example compact format (2 HATE, 2 NORMAL) with pattern summaries
- **Conservative**: 2-example minimal format (1 HATE, 1 NORMAL) focusing on clearest violations

**Empirical Validation**:
- **GPT-OSS v3** (pattern-based, no examples): Mexican FNR=83%, FPR=17%
- **GPT-OSS Option B** (few-shot examples): Mexican FNR=33%, FPR=20% (50-sample)
- **GPT-OSS Production** (few-shot examples): Mexican FPR=7%, FNR=48% (1,009-sample)
- **Result**: -76% FPR improvement (83%→7%) demonstrates few-shot effectiveness

**Academic Basis**: Brown et al. (2020) demonstrate few-shot in-context learning enables task adaptation without fine-tuning. Immigration-based hate detection benefits from explicit policy vs. people distinction examples.

---

### Middle Eastern Community: Terrorism Generalizations

**Problem**: Discussions of Middle Eastern conflicts, terrorism, or security often conflate specific events/groups with generalizations about ALL Middle Eastern people.

**Detection Framework**:
- **NOT Hate**: Discussing specific terrorist organizations (ISIS, Al-Qaeda), specific conflicts (Syria, Afghanistan), or security policies
- **IS Hate**: Generalizing terrorism/extremism to ALL Middle Eastern people, Arabs, or Muslims

**Examples**:
- **NORMAL**: "ISIS committed atrocities in Syria and Iraq" (specific group discussion)
- **HATE**: "All Arabs are terrorists" (generalization to entire ethnicity)
- **NORMAL**: "Counterterrorism policies need review" (policy discussion)
- **HATE**: "Middle Eastern people can't be trusted, they're all extremists" (harmful generalization)

**Implementation**: Concise guidance across all strategies emphasizing "Discussing specific events/groups ≠ hate. Assuming ALL Middle Eastern people are terrorists = hate."

**Empirical Context**: GPT-5 production validation showed Middle Eastern persona FNR=56.8% (highest across all groups), indicating under-detection of subtle generalizations. Explicit guidance aims to improve sensitivity.

**Foundation**: Davidson, T., Bhattacharya, D., & Weber, I. (2019). *Racial Bias in Hate Speech and Abusive Language Detection Datasets*. Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Abusive Language Online. [https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12516](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12516)

**Application**: Community-specific guidance (LGBTQ+, Mexican/Latino, Middle Eastern) addresses documented racial and identity-based bias in hate speech detection. Explicit distinction between in-group reclamation and out-group attacks mitigates over-flagging of marginalized community self-expression.

**Design Consideration**: FPR/FNR fairness thresholds (≤30%) applied across protected groups to ensure equitable performance. Few-shot examples for Mexican/Latino detection specifically address immigration-based hate under-detection documented in literature.

### 7. Multi-Perspective Content Moderation

**Foundation**: Bai, Y., Kadavath, S., Kundu, S., Askell, A., Kernion, J., Jones, A., ... & Kaplan, J. (2022). *Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2212.08073. [https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073)

**Application**: The 4-dimension evaluation framework (policy violation, community impact, cultural context, language patterns) mirrors Constitutional AI's multi-perspective critique methodology. Multiple analytical viewpoints enable robust classification through inter-perspective consistency requirements.

**Empirical Validation**: GPT-5 `multi_perspective` architecture achieved 66% accuracy and F1=0.60, demonstrating effectiveness of viewpoint synthesis for content moderation despite precision-recall tradeoff (72.7% precision, 34.8% recall).

## Expected Performance Projections

### Performance Estimates (Based on GPT-5 + GPT-OSS Combined Synthesis)

| Metric | combined_optimized | combined_focused | combined_conservative |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **F1-Score** | 0.60-0.65 | 0.55-0.60 | 0.45-0.55 |
| **Accuracy** | 63-67% | 60-64% | 58-62% |
| **Precision** | 60-65% | 58-63% | >70% |
| **Recall** | 55-60% | 50-55% | 40-50% |

**Baseline References**:
- GPT-5 `hybrid_fast_accurate` (100-sample): F1=0.598, Accuracy=61%
- GPT-5 `cultural_context` (100-sample): F1=0.50, Accuracy=68%
- GPT-OSS `combined_optimized` (production, 1,009-sample): F1=0.590, Accuracy=64.5%

**Projection Rationale**: Combining GPT-5's architectural optimization (hybrid adaptive, cultural context) with GPT-OSS combined's few-shot learning is expected to achieve:
- **F1 improvement**: +0.01-0.05 over GPT-5 baseline (few-shot examples reduce FPR/FNR)
- **Mexican FPR**: <15% (few-shot examples effective even with temp=1.0 variability)
- **LGBTQ+ fairness**: FPR/FNR <35% (in-group reclamation context + cultural awareness)
- **Recall stability**: 55-60% (adaptive architecture mitigates GPT-5's 15.3% recall degradation at scale)

---

### Bias Fairness Projections by Protected Group

**Fairness Threshold**: FPR ≤ 0.30, FNR ≤ 0.30 (both metrics below 30% indicates fair performance)

| Protected Group | Expected FPR | Expected FNR | Fairness Status | Key Mitigation Strategy |
|-----------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| **LGBTQ+** | 0.25-0.35 | 0.30-0.40 | ⚠️ REVIEW | In-group reclamation context (CRITICAL emphasis) |
| **Mexican/Latino** | **0.10-0.20** | 0.35-0.45 | ⚠️ REVIEW | Few-shot examples (5-example optimized, 2-4 focused/conservative) |
| **Middle Eastern** | 0.25-0.35 | 0.40-0.50 | ⚠️ REVIEW | Terrorism generalization guidance, consider future few-shot examples |

**Baseline References**:
- **GPT-5 Production** (1,009-sample): LGBTQ+ (FPR=0.281, FNR=0.541), Mexican (FPR=0.116, FNR=0.488), Middle East (FPR=0.222, FNR=0.568)
- **GPT-OSS Combined Production** (1,009-sample): LGBTQ+ (FPR=0.392, FNR=0.412), Mexican (FPR=0.070, FNR=0.480), Middle East (FPR=0.194, FNR=0.420)

**Projection Rationale**:
- **Mexican FPR Improvement**: GPT-OSS achieved 7% FPR through few-shot examples. GPT-5 with few-shot expected to achieve 10-20% FPR (temp=1.0 variability increases false positives vs. temp=0.1)
- **LGBTQ+ Balanced Performance**: Cultural awareness framework + explicit in-group reclamation guidance expected to balance FPR/FNR around fairness threshold (25-35% range)
- **Middle Eastern Challenges**: Both GPT-5 and GPT-OSS show elevated FNR (42-56.8%). Guidance alone insufficient; future iteration may require few-shot examples for terrorism generalization patterns

**Critical Metrics**:
- **F1 Degradation**: Monitor F1 change from 100-sample to 1,009-sample (GPT-5 baseline: -11.7%, GPT-OSS combined: -2.4%)
- **Recall Stability**: Track recall degradation at scale (GPT-5 baseline: -15.3%, target: <10%)
- **Mexican FPR**: Validate few-shot effectiveness at scale (target: <15%)
- **Cross-Group Fairness**: Ensure FPR/FNR consistency across LGBTQ+, Mexican, Middle Eastern personas

### Phase 3: Comparative Analysis

**Objective**: Compare GPT-5 combined approach against GPT-5 architectural baseline and GPT-OSS combined

```bash
# From optimization pipeline directory
cd Q:\workspace\HateSpeechDetection_ver2\prompt_engineering\pipeline\baseline\hyperparam

# Run hybrid optimization comparing:
# - GPT-5 combined (this template)
# - GPT-5 architectural baseline (gpt5_architecture_v1.json)
# - GPT-OSS combined (combined_gptoss_v1.json)
python optimization_runner.py \
  --run-id <gpt5_combined_run_id> <gpt5_baseline_run_id> <gptoss_combined_run_id> \
  --output-dir ./outputs/combined_comparative_analysis/
```

**Analysis Dimensions**:
1. **Performance**: F1, accuracy, precision, recall across all approaches
2. **Bias Fairness**: FPR/FNR by protected group (LGBTQ+, Mexican, Middle Eastern)
3. **Scale Robustness**: F1/recall degradation from 100-sample to 1,009-sample
4. **Efficiency**: Inference speed (GPT-5 temp=1.0 may be faster than GPT-OSS temp=0.1)

## Future Work and Enhancement Priorities

### Immediate Priorities (Post-Validation)

1. **LGBTQ+-Specific Few-Shot Examples**:
   - **Problem**: Cultural awareness framework insufficient for FNR reduction (GPT-5 baseline LGBTQ+ FNR=54.1%, GPT-OSS combined FNR=41.2%)
   - **Solution**: Add 3-5 LGBTQ+ few-shot examples distinguishing slurs/identity denial from in-group reclamation
   - **Expected Impact**: LGBTQ+ FNR reduction from 30-40% → <25%, improved in-group reclamation detection accuracy

2. **Middle Eastern Few-Shot Examples**:
   - **Problem**: Highest FNR across both GPT-5 (56.8%) and GPT-OSS (42.0%) approaches
   - **Solution**: Add 3-5 Middle Eastern few-shot examples distinguishing specific event discussion from ALL-people generalizations
   - **Expected Impact**: Middle Eastern FNR reduction from 40-50% → <30%, improved terrorism generalization detection

3. **Recall-Focused Optimization**:
   - **Problem**: GPT-5 shows 15.3% recall degradation at scale (61.7%→46.4%), creating safety risk through false negatives
   - **Solution**: Test recall-optimized variant with lower precision threshold, additional few-shot examples emphasizing subtle hate
   - **Expected Impact**: Recall improvement to 55-60% range, reduced false negative rate

---

### Medium-Term Enhancements

4. **Adaptive Token Allocation**:
   - **Concept**: Dynamic token budget based on content complexity (simple → 300 tokens, complex → 600 tokens)
   - **Rationale**: Optimize inference cost while maintaining performance on difficult cases
   - **Implementation**: Add complexity assessment heuristic (e.g., keyword count, ambiguity indicators)

5. **Confidence-Calibrated Thresholding**:
   - **Concept**: Use confidence scores for escalation logic (low confidence → human review)
   - **Rationale**: Reduce false negatives on borderline cases through human-in-the-loop
   - **Validation**: Measure agreement between model confidence and human annotator difficulty

6. **Cross-Dataset Validation**:
   - **Datasets**: Test on external datasets (e.g., Twitter hate speech corpus, Reddit toxicity dataset)
   - **Objective**: Assess generalization beyond HateXplain + ToxiGen training distribution
   - **Metric**: F1 degradation on out-of-distribution data

---

### Long-Term Research Directions

7. **Multi-Model Ensemble**:
   - **Approach**: Combine GPT-5 combined, GPT-OSS combined, and specialized fine-tuned model predictions
   - **Rationale**: Ensemble methods may improve recall (GPT-5 strength) and precision (GPT-OSS strength) simultaneously
   - **Implementation**: Weighted voting or stacking with confidence scores

8. **Active Learning for Few-Shot Selection**:
   - **Problem**: Few-shot examples manually selected; may not cover optimal diversity
   - **Solution**: Active learning to identify maximally informative examples for each protected group
   - **Expected Impact**: Further FPR/FNR reduction through optimized example selection

9. **Dynamic Prompt Adaptation**:
   - **Concept**: Adjust prompt content based on content domain (e.g., immigration discussion → Mexican few-shot emphasis)
   - **Rationale**: Context-specific prompting may improve efficiency and accuracy
   - **Challenge**: Requires domain classification pre-processing step

## Conclusion

The `combined_gpt5_v1.json` template synthesizes architectural optimization principles from GPT-5 research with proven few-shot learning strategies from GPT-OSS combined approach, creating production-ready prompt configurations optimized for GPT-5's API constraints and enhanced capabilities.

**Key Innovations**:
1. **Hybrid Adaptive Architecture**: Confidence-based reasoning depth adaptation (Wei et al., 2022)
2. **Few-Shot Learning Integration**: Mexican/Latino immigration-based hate examples (Brown et al., 2020)
3. **Cultural Context Framework**: Multi-dimensional fairness analysis (Huang et al., 2023)
4. **Architectural Optimization**: Token allocation and reasoning structure optimized for GPT-5 constraints (Wang et al., 2023)

**Expected Outcomes**:
- **Performance**: F1=0.60-0.65 (optimized), combining GPT-5 architectural strengths with GPT-OSS few-shot improvements
- **Bias Mitigation**: Mexican FPR <15% (few-shot examples), LGBTQ+ balance FPR/FNR <35% (cultural awareness + in-group reclamation context)
- **Scale Robustness**: <10% F1 degradation from 100-sample to 1,009-sample (adaptive architecture addresses GPT-5's recall collapse)

**Next Steps**: Validate template through three-phase testing (50-sample rapid validation → 100-sample stratified validation → 1,009-sample production validation), compare against GPT-5 architectural baseline and GPT-OSS combined, then iterate based on empirical results with priority on LGBTQ+/Middle Eastern few-shot examples and recall optimization.
