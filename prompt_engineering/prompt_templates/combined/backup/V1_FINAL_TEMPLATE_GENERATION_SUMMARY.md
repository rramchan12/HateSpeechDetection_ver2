# V1 Final Template Generation Summary

**Date**: October 18, 2025  
**Action**: Rewrite v1 template files using Option B (few-shot examples) as the production base

---

## Executive Summary

The `combined_gptoss_v1.json` and `combined_gptoss_v1_README.md` files have been **completely rewritten** to incorporate the few-shot examples approach (Option B) that achieved the best empirical results during iterative validation testing.

**Key Achievement**: Conservative strategy with few-shot examples achieved:
- **71% accuracy** (highest across all variants)
- **0.667 F1-score** (highest across all variants)
- **Mexican FNR: 33%** (down from 83%, -50% improvement)
- **LGBTQ+ FPR/FNR: 25%/25%** (perfect balance)

This represents the culmination of iterative prompt engineering through v2, v3, and Option B/C testing.

## Rationale for Changes

### 1. Why Option B (Few-Shot Examples)?

**Empirical Evidence**:
- Conservative strategy: 71% accuracy vs. 58-60% for other Option B strategies
- Consistency: ALL Option B strategies achieved 33% Mexican FNR (vs. Option C focused at 83%)
- Option C optimized: Better LGBTQ+ FNR (11%) but lower overall performance (60% accuracy)

**Decision**: Option B provides better foundation for production deployment:
- Highest overall performance (71% accuracy, 0.667 F1)
- More consistent across strategies
- Interpretable examples make model behavior predictable
- Deterministic sampling (conservative) synergizes with concrete examples

### 2. Why Conservative Strategy Now Recommended?

**Original Ranking** (baseline testing):
1. combined_optimized (F1=0.626)
2. combined_focused (F1=0.600)
3. combined_conservative (F1=0.594)

**V1 Ranking** (with few-shot examples):
1. **combined_conservative (F1=0.667)** ✅✅✅ +11% accuracy
2. combined_optimized (F1=0.571)
3. combined_focused (F1=0.400)

**Key Insight**: Deterministic greedy decoding (temp=0.0) benefits MOST from concrete examples because it eliminates sampling variability and consistently selects the same pattern-matched tokens. This creates a "goldilocks" combination:
- Few-shot examples teach clear patterns (hate vs. normal)
- Deterministic decoding consistently applies those patterns
- Result: Highest accuracy and F1 across all tested configurations

### 3. Token Allocation Strategy

**combined_optimized**: 512 tokens
- Sufficient space for 5-example block + full community guidance
- Allows detailed explanations
- Temperature 0.1 provides slight randomness, benefits from more context

**combined_focused**: 200 → 256 tokens
- **Critical change**: Needed 28% more tokens to fit LGBTQ+ context restoration
- Compact 2-example format for efficiency
- Still shows issues (LGBTQ+ FNR 89%) suggesting 256 may still be insufficient

**combined_conservative**: 256 tokens
- Optimal for conservative: Enough for 2-example format + core guidance
- Deterministic nature means every token counts (no hedging/variability)
- Achieved best balance at this token budget

## Migration Guide

### For Users Currently Using v1 (Pre-Enhancement)

**Breaking Changes**: None - JSON structure unchanged

**Behavioral Changes**:
1. Mexican/Latino detection significantly improved (expect -50% false negatives)
2. Conservative strategy now performs best (consider switching from optimized)
3. Focused strategy may overcriminalize LGBTQ+ content (use cautiously)

**Recommended Action**:
```bash
# Test conservative strategy on your dataset
python prompt_runner.py --data-source <your_data> \
  --strategies combined_conservative \
  --output-dir outputs/v1_enhanced_test/gptoss/ \
  --max-workers 15 --batch-size 8 \
  --prompt-template-file combined/combined_gptoss_v1.json

# Compare with previous optimized results
# If conservative performs better, switch production to conservative
```

### For Users Currently Using Option B Template

**Action**: Rename `combined_gptoss_v1_optionB_fewshot.json` usage to `combined_gptoss_v1.json`

**Why**: Option B IS NOW the official v1 template. The Option B file is kept for historical reference, but all future development should use `combined_gptoss_v1.json`.

## Performance Expectations

### Expected Metrics (50-sample validation baseline)

| Strategy | Accuracy | F1 | Mexican FNR | LGBTQ+ FPR | LGBTQ+ FNR |
|----------|----------|-------|-------------|------------|------------|
| **conservative** | **71%** | **0.667** | **33%** | **25%** | **25%** |
| optimized | 58% | 0.571 | 33% | 50% | 33% |
| focused | 52% | 0.400 | 33% | 44% | 89% |

### Scaling to Production (1,009 samples)

**Expected behavior** based on baseline testing patterns:
- Accuracy may decrease 2-5% on larger dataset (more diversity)
- F1-score typically stable within ±0.05
- Bias metrics may shift 5-10% due to demographic distribution differences

**Recommendation**: Run full production validation before deployment:
```bash
python prompt_runner.py --data-source unified \
  --strategies combined_conservative \
  --output-dir outputs/v1_production_validation/gptoss/ \
  --max-workers 15 --batch-size 8 \
  --prompt-template-file combined/combined_gptoss_v1.json
```

## Future Work

### Known Issues to Address

1. **Focused Variant LGBTQ+ FNR**: 89% false negative rate unacceptable
   - **Hypothesis**: 256 tokens still insufficient for full context
   - **Potential fix**: Increase to 384 tokens OR simplify other sections

2. **Middle Eastern FPR Regression**: Optimized variant 17%→67% FPR
   - **Hypothesis**: Mexican examples confused model about Middle Eastern content
   - **Potential fix**: Add Middle Eastern few-shot examples for balance

3. **Optimized Strategy Performance Decline**: 66%→58% accuracy
   - **Hypothesis**: Temperature 0.1 introduces variability that doesn't synergize with examples
   - **Potential fix**: Test temperature 0.05 for optimized variant

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Production Validation**: Run on full 1,009-sample dataset to confirm 71% accuracy scales
2. **Middle Eastern Enhancement**: Create few-shot examples for Middle Eastern detection
3. **Focused Variant Redesign**: Either increase tokens to 384 or deprecate this variant
4. **Cross-Model Testing**: Validate few-shot approach on other models (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)

## Conclusion

The v1 template has been successfully enhanced with few-shot examples, achieving:
- ✅ **71% accuracy** (highest across all variants)
- ✅ **Mexican FNR reduced 83%→33%** (primary goal achieved)
- ✅ **LGBTQ+ balance restored** in conservative variant (25%/25%)
- ✅ **Conservative strategy now recommended** for production

This represents a significant improvement from the v3 baseline and validates the few-shot learning approach for hate speech detection with gpt-oss-120b model.

**Next milestone**: Production validation on full 1,009-sample unified dataset to confirm scalability.
