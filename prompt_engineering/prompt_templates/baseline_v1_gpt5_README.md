## GPT-5 Specific Parameter Analysis

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **API Compatibility Note**

This template uses the standard Chat Completions API with traditional parameters (temperature, top_p, frequency_penalty, presence_penalty). The `reasoning_effort` parameter is not supported in this configuration as it requires the Responses API, which has limitations on other sampling parameters. GPT-5's enhanced reasoning capabilities are leveraged through optimized prompt engineering and parameter tuning rather than explicit reasoning effort controls.

### üéØ **Temperature Optimization for GPT-5**

GPT-5's improved baseline reasoning allows for more aggressive temperature reduction [1]. Research demonstrates that model performance and calibration both improve with scale, supporting lower temperature values for critical classification tasks [6]. Studies on frontier models like GPT-5 show remarkable stability with controlled temperature settings, particularly for tasks requiring linguistic robustness [5]:

- **0.0 (Conservative)**: Perfect determinism leveraging GPT-5's enhanced consistency
- **0.02 (Focused)**: Near-zero randomness with GPT-5's precision capabilities
- **0.05 (Standard)**: Minimal creativity optimized for GPT-5's reasoning architecture
- **0.08 (Balanced)**: Production-optimized for GPT-5's balanced performance
- **0.15 (Creative)**: Controlled creativity leveraging enhanced reasoning
- **0.25 (Exploratory)**: Higher creativity with GPT-5's improved guidance control

### üéØ **top_p Nucleus Sampling for GPT-5**

GPT-5's enhanced token selection benefits from optimized nucleus sampling [2]. The nucleus sampling approach prevents neural text degeneration while maintaining quality, particularly critical for content moderation tasks where precision is paramount. Chain-of-thought research indicates that coherent reasoning steps are more important than diverse outputs for classification tasks [7]:

- **0.75 (Focused)**: Ultra-conservative selection leveraging improved precision
- **0.85 (Conservative)**: Balanced focus with GPT-5's enhanced coherence
- **0.88 (Exploratory)**: Diverse selection with maintained quality control
- **0.9 (Standard/Balanced)**: Optimal balance for GPT-5's token distribution
- **0.92 (Creative)**: Enhanced diversity with GPT-5's improved coherence

### üéØ **max_tokens Optimization for GPT-5**

GPT-5's efficiency improvements allow for optimized token allocation. Research on large language model evaluation shows that performance scales with available reasoning space, but with diminishing returns beyond optimal lengths [6]. Chain-of-thought studies demonstrate that relevant reasoning steps matter more than length [7]:

- **150 (Focused)**: Ultra-efficient for high-speed classification
- **200 (Conservative)**: Minimal but adequate leveraging GPT-5's conciseness
- **300 (Standard)**: Balanced allocation for GPT-5's optimal reasoning length
- **350 (Balanced)**: Production-optimized for comprehensive explanations
- **500 (Creative)**: Enhanced reasoning space for complex analysis
- **800 (Exploratory)**: Full analytical capability for edge case discovery

### üéØ **Penalty Parameters for GPT-5**

GPT-5's improved coherence allows for more nuanced penalty application. Large-scale evaluation studies show that modern language models demonstrate better natural diversity and topic coherence [6], reducing the need for aggressive penalty parameters that can harm reasoning quality [7]:

- **frequency_penalty**: Lower values (0.0-0.15) due to GPT-5's natural diversity and improved repetition handling
- **presence_penalty**: Minimal values (0.0-0.1) leveraging improved topic coherence and reasoning consistency
