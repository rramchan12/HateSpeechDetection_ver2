## Motivation and Rationale

### Why Unify HateXplain and ToxiGen?

The unification of HateXplain and ToxiGen datasets addresses a critical need in hate speech detection research: **capturing different modalities of hate speech** while maintaining balanced representation for robust model training.

#### **Complementary Hate Speech Types:**
- **HateXplain**: Persona-based hate with explicit targeting and human rationales
- **ToxiGen**: Implicit hate with subtle, context-dependent toxicity

#### **Research Benefits:**
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Both explicit and implicit hate patterns
- **Rich Training Signals**: Human rationales for interpretable AI
- **Bias Evaluation**: Multi-demographic representation
- **Robust Generalization**: Diverse hate speech modalities

### **Initial Challenge: Severe Source Imbalance**

**Original Unified Dataset (Before Balancing):**
```
Total Entries: 64,321
├── HateXplain: 2,726 samples (4.2%) - Persona-based hate
└── ToxiGen: 61,595 samples (95.8%) - Implicit hate

Class Distribution:
├── Hate: 30,164 samples (46.9%)
└── Normal: 34,157 samples (53.1%)

Rationale Coverage: 3.2% (only HateXplain has rationales)
```

**Key Problems:**
1. **Severe source imbalance** (1:22.6 ratio)
2. **Poor rationale coverage** (3.2%)
3. **Overwhelming ToxiGen dominance** (95.8%)
4. **Limited interpretability** (minimal rationale signals)

## Unification Approaches Considered

### **Approach 1: No Balancing (Original)**
```
HateXplain: 2,726 (4.2%)
ToxiGen: 61,595 (95.8%)
Total: 64,321 samples
```
**Pros**: Maximum data retention  
**Cons**: Severe source imbalance, poor rationale coverage (3.2%)

### **Approach 2: Class Balancing Only**
```
Target: Equal hate vs normal samples
Method: Undersample majority class
```
**Pros**: Balanced hate/normal distribution  
**Cons**: Doesn't address source imbalance, still poor rationale coverage

### **Approach 3: ToxiGen Class Balancing**
```
Target: Balance classes within ToxiGen only
Method: Equal hate/normal within each target group
```
**Pros**: Balanced ToxiGen representation  
**Cons**: Source imbalance remains (1:22.6 ratio)

### **Approach 4: Source Balancing - Equal (1:1)**
```
HateXplain: 2,726 (50.0%)
ToxiGen: 2,726 (50.0%)  
Total: 5,452 samples
```
**Pros**: Perfect source balance, high rationale coverage (50%)  
**Cons**: Significant data reduction (91.5%)

### **Approach 5: Source Balancing - 1:2 Ratio**
```
HateXplain: 2,726 (33.3%)
ToxiGen: 5,452 (66.7%)
Total: 8,178 samples
```
**Pros**: Good balance with more ToxiGen representation  
**Cons**: Lower rationale coverage (33%)

### **Approach 6: Source Balancing - 1:3 Ratio**
```
HateXplain: 2,726 (25.0%)
ToxiGen: 8,178 (75.0%)
Total: 10,904 samples
```
**Pros**: Strong implicit hate representation  
**Cons**: Lower rationale coverage (25%)

## Selected Approach: 1:1 Source Balancing

### **Rationale for Selection**

The **1:1 source balancing approach** was selected based on the following considerations:

#### **1. Balanced Hate Modalities**
- **Equal representation** of persona-based and implicit hate
- **Comprehensive learning** from both hate speech types
- **Robust generalization** across different hate patterns

#### **2. Maximum Rationale Coverage**  
- **50% rationale coverage** vs original 3.2% (15x improvement)
- **Rich interpretability signals** for explainable AI
- **Human-annotated explanations** for model understanding

#### **3. Quality over Quantity**
- **Premium, curated dataset** with balanced representation
- **Focused learning** without noisy, redundant samples  
- **Efficient training** with meaningful examples

#### **4. Research Applications**
- **Bias evaluation** with equal source representation
- **Interpretability research** with high rationale coverage
- **Comparative analysis** of hate speech modalities

### **Implementation Strategy**

```python
def balance_source_distribution(toxigen_multiplier=1.0):
    # Keep ALL HateXplain (valuable rationales)
    # Sample ToxiGen proportionally across target groups
    # Maintain 50/50 class balance within each group
    # Preserve original train/val/test split ratios
```

**Key Features:**
- **Stratified sampling** across target groups
- **Class balance preservation** within each group  
- **Reproducible results** (random seed = 42)
- **Split ratio maintenance** (70.4% train, 10.0% val, 19.6% test)
